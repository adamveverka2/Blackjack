## Blackjack
#blackjack on rp pico controlled using buttons

normal blackjack  
still work in progress  

hit function: works  
pass function: works  
double function: woks #sometimes runs game() function without player input after reseting the game  
split function:  
  -hit function works but fails to calculate fails to fo to the game() function  
  -pass function works for first hand and then switches to second hand but then starts the game() function  
  -double funtion for split is not integrated yet  

I wrote this code mostly my self with and used chatGPT to shorten specific function
